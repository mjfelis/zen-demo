Digital trust is collapsing due to AI-driven fraud, deepfakes, and regulatory complexity. Businesses need better privacy, automation, and compliance, while consumers, overwhelmed by privacy concerns, need solutions for re-enabling digital trust.

Verana's mission is to provide a new, decentralized, and universal trust layer to make the Internet verifiable, for re-enabling trust.

Like the DNS (Domain Name System) provides a way of resolving domain names, the Verana Foundation is building the bricks to resolve, verify, and prove trust.

- DNS: Resolve domain names
- VTR: Verifiable Trust Resolver
