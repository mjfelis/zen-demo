## Our Mission

Digital trust is collapsing due to AI-driven fraud, deepfakes, and regulatory complexity. Businesses need better privacy, automation, and compliance, while consumers, overwhelmed by privacy concerns, present both risks and opportunities for new trust models.

Verana's mission is to provide a new, decentralized, and universal trust layer to make the Internet verifiable.

Like the DNS (Domain Name System) provides a way of resolving domain names, the Verana Foundation is building the **concrete** bricks to resolve, verify, and prove trust.

- DNS: Resolve domain names
- Verana: Resolve Proof of Trust

## What we enable

We enable the principle: "Don't trust, verify".

Here we will show a nice diagram.
