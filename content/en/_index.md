## Our Mission

Digital trust is collapsing due to AI-driven fraud, deepfakes, and regulatory complexity. Businesses need better privacy, automation, and compliance, while consumers, overwhelmed by privacy concerns, need solutions for re-enabling digital trust.

Verana's mission is to provide a new, decentralized, and universal trust layer to make the Internet verifiable, for re-enabling trust.

Like the DNS (Domain Name System) provides a way of resolving domain names, the Verana Foundation is building the bricks to resolve, verify, and prove trust.

- DNS: Resolve domain names
- VTR: Verifiable Trust Resolver

## Our Vision

### Verifiable Interactions

Internet is an heterogeneous world where several kind of participants cohabits and build interactions:

- Organizations,
- Services,
- Persons,
- Things,
- User Agents: Apps, Browsers,...
- AI Agents,
...

Interactions between participants work by establishing connections and exchanging information through the established connections.

There are each time more communication channels, more way of establishing connections and interacting with participants in the Internet. Unfortunately, the protocols and services that are involved for establishing those connections does not provide a sure-fire way of identifying and verifying the connection participants.

As a consequence, participants are always at risk of sharing information to the wrong entity. A simple example very easy to understand, that is part of our daily life: when you receive a GSM call from an unknown number, claiming they are the bank. How can you verify they are the bank?

Few methods have been invented as a workaround, but all these methods are tedious and outdated, and make user experience a pain. And, usually, these methods are for authenticating the consumers only, not the services nor their providers.

At the Verana Foundation, we believe that with the generalization of the usage of Verifiable Credentials, any Internet participant should be able to easily and instantly verify the identity of the other participants, before starting to exchange information in an established connection. Note that by identity, we do not necessarily mean official identity. An influencer could be identified, say, by an avatar, but, as a user, I know this avatar identifies the influencer I want to connect to.

### Verifiable Data

Furthermore, viewed from another angle, for participants, it is a very complex task to collect "true" data and verify it. And if one needs to verify the collected information, it is often done by sub-contracting the task to a third party company or service (like for verifying identities), which is costly, and implies sharing user data massively.

We believe it should be straightforward for anyone to verify the authenticity of any kind of claims issued in a verifiable credential by a participant I (Issuer) to a participant H (Holder) and presented by H to a participant V (Verifier):

- is participant I (Issuer) enabled for issuing a credential with these claims to participant H (Holder)?
- is participant V (Verifier) allowed to request participant H (Holder) presentation of a credential issued by participant I (Issuer)?
- does participant V (Verifier) trusts the credentials issued by participant I (Issuer)?
- can participant V (Verifier) be sure a 100% that data presented by participant H (Holder) has not been tempered with?

In other words, as a user, if a plumber presents a plumber credential to me:

- I want to verify that the plumber credential has not been tempered with;
- I want to verify who is the issuer of the credential, and if I recognize this issuer as a legit issuer for plumber credentials;
- When plumber arrives, I can verify that his face matches the picture of the plumber certificate.

### Privacy-preserving identity-tied reputation, and self moderation

In the previous section, we talked about identity, and we defined that an identity is not necessarily a real identity, but could be represented by an avatar instead.

Building a reputation takes time. How many months needs an influencer to build a network of millions of followers linked to his Avatar?

Making Service Identification mandatory has a huge additional benefit: it enables self-moderation of participants.



## What we enable

We enable the principle: "Don't trust, verify".





- any Service, User Agent (Mobile App, Browser),... MUST be Verifiable.
- users 

Here we will show a nice diagram.
