### Verifiable Interactions

The Internet is a heterogeneous world where various types of participants coexist and interact:

- Organizations
- Services
- Individuals
- Things
- User Agents (e.g., apps, browsers)
- AI Agents
...

Interactions between participants occur by establishing connections and exchanging information.

With the growing number of communication channels and connection methods, the challenge of verifying participants' identities has become more pressing. Unfortunately, existing protocols and services do not offer a reliable way to identify and authenticate connection participants with certainty.

As a result, there is always a risk of sharing information with the wrong entity. A common example from everyday life illustrates this: when you receive a call from an unknown number claiming to be your bank, how can you verify their identity?

Several workaround methods have been developed, but they are often cumbersome, outdated, and degrade the user experience. Moreover, these methods primarily focus on authenticating consumers rather than services or their providers.

At the Verana Foundation, we believe that the widespread adoption of Verifiable Credentials can enable any Internet participant to instantly and effortlessly verify the identity of others before exchanging information. Importantly, identity does not necessarily mean official identity. For instance, an influencer may be identified by an avatar rather than a legal name—but as a user, I can trust that this avatar represents the influencer I intend to connect with.

### Verifiable Data

From another perspective, verifying the authenticity of data is a complex task for participants. Collecting "true" data and ensuring its accuracy often requires outsourcing verification to third-party companies or services (such as identity verification providers). This approach is costly and results in the widespread sharing of user data.

We believe that by generalizing the use of Verifiable Credentials (VCs), verifying the authenticity of any presented data could become seamless. VCs ensure that the information they contain has not been tampered with—but that alone is not enough. To establish true trust, we must answer the following key questions:

- Is the Issuer (I) authorized to issue this credential with these claims to the Holder (H)?

- Is the Verifier (V) permitted to request H to present a credential issued by I?

- Does V trust credentials issued by I?

In practical terms, imagine a plumber presents a credential verifying their qualifications:

- I need to confirm that the credential has not been altered.

- I want to verify who issued the credential and whether I recognize them as a legitimate authority for plumbing certifications.

- When the plumber arrives, I should be able to match their face to the credential.

By addressing these questions, we move beyond simple data integrity and toward a fully trustable and verifiable ecosystem for digital credentials.

### Privacy-preserving identity-tied reputation, and self moderation

In the previous section, we talked about identity, and we defined that an identity is not necessarily a real identity, but could be represented by an avatar instead.

Building a reputation takes time. How many months needs an influencer to build a network of millions of followers linked to his Avatar?

Making Service Identification mandatory has a huge additional benefit: it enables self-moderation of participants.



## What we enable

We enable the principle: "Don't trust, verify".





- any Service, User Agent (Mobile App, Browser),... MUST be Verifiable.

Here we will show a nice diagram.
