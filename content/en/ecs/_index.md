## What are Essential Credential Schemas?

Essential Credential Schemas (ECS) are the foundational building blocks of digital trust within the Verifiable Trust ecosystem. They define a minimum, verifiable set of credentials that services and user agents must present in order to establish their legitimacy and participate in secure, trustable interactions.

There are four core types of Essential Credential Schemas:

Service ECS — Verifies the identity and attributes of a digital service.

Organization ECS — Establishes the legal and public legitimacy of an organization.

Person ECS — Provides proof of identity for individuals, respecting privacy-by-design.

User Agent ECS — Ensures that software connecting to services complies with trust and privacy requirements.

These schemas enable verifiable services (VS) and verifiable user agents (VUA) to authenticate themselves and each other, making communication channels inherently more secure and privacy-respecting.

## Governance of ECS

The Verana Foundation serves as the governance authority for Essential Credential Schemas. Its role includes:

- Defining and maintaining ECS standards to ensure clarity, interoperability, and privacy-respecting design.

- Operating trust registries within Verifiable Public Registries (VPRs), where ECS credential schemas are formally published.

- Appointing issuer grantors and issuers, who are authorized to issue ECS-compliant credentials under defined governance rules.

- Enforcing credential quality and issuer integrity through trust registries, validation processes, and compliance with Verana’s governance framework.

- Ensuring neutrality and openness, so that ECS remain vendor-independent, accessible, and aligned with public interest values.

This approach guarantees that the core identity credentials of the Verifiable Trust ecosystem are not controlled by a single actor, but are instead governed transparently and collectively—with the Verana Foundation acting as a neutral steward.
